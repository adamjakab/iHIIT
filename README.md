iHIIT
=====

High Intensity Interval Training (or any other repetition based) App for your Garmin device.


How to obtain it?
---------------
You can install the app on your device through the IQ app store. This is a [direct link](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/bc02f0f2-9d7d-4476-8aaf-ef99f2e78c33) to the app page.


How does it work?
-----------------
You can configure up to 5 workouts, each of which can contain up to 20 exercises. Each workout will have an exercise duration (by default 40 seconds) and a rest duration (by default 20 seconds). Just name your workout, add the name of the exercises and get ready to sweat.

When you start the app on your watch it will propose you the configured workouts. You can scroll through the exercises with the up/down buttons and select one with the activity button. Once selected, iHIIT will lead you through your configured exercises alternating between exercise and rest periods.


How to configure iHIIT?
-----------------
The easiest way to configure iHIIT is through the use of GarminExpress application installed on your PC. Select the `iHIIT` application from the list of IQ Apps installed on your device. Hit the `...` button next to the name of of the application to open the configuration window. Enter/change your configuration and click `Save`. Your configuration will be immediately transferred to your device.

For each workout you can configure the following:
- Title
- Exercise duration (seconds)
- Rest duration between exercises (seconds)
- Enabled (Yes/No)
- Name of exercises (1-20)

Exercises must be consecutive. The first blank exercise title will indicate the end of the workout.
